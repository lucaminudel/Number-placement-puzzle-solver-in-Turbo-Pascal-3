# Number-placement puzzle solver in Turbo Pascal 3
An old number placement puzzle solver in Turbo Pascal 3.0.

This is a number placement puzzle solver.
To solve the puzzle, the initial number 1 can be placed everywhere on a 5 x 5 grid.
Each following consecutive number can be placed diagonally, two sqares away, or horizontally, three squares away.
The puzzle is solved when all the grid is filled with all numbers from 1 to 25.

The difficulty increases explonentially as the size of the grid increases.
This application breaks down a 10 x 10 grid into four 5 x 5 grids and solves them individually, in a much much more efficient way.

You can download the release from here https://github.com/lucaminudel/Number-placement-puzzle-solver-in-Turbo-Pascal-3/releases/tag/V1.0 and run it with an online MS-DOS emulator like this: https://virtualconsoles.com/online-emulators/dos/
